This folder contains the HDL code for an 8 to 3 decoder block, which will be used in the instructions SM and LM, 
for converting the last 8 bits of the instruction to a 3 bit address which can be directly fed to the register file.
It has 8 bit input and 3 bit output, and a clock input.
It is thus obviously clock synchronised.
